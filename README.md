# formol - toxic wasteland of a submission form
This is a toxic project developed under extreme circumstances for a desperate client within extreme development constraints. 
We suggest not using this if your dev environment is configurable to suit well written code.

If you are in a tough situation in which you need to circumvent all convention and are forced to use javascript to submit a form, 
need a direct (super dangerous) connection to a DB, and just generally limited resources, then by all means, get dirty with it.
